# Digital Marketing Techniques
Modern digital marketing relies on technology to analyze the comprehensive performance of a business’ marketing campaign, 
and help guide future strategies and decision-making. 

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
Search Engine Optimization is the process of improving your website to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business 
in Google, Bing, and other search engines. 
On-page SEO is the practice of optimizing individual web pages in order to rank higher and earn more relevant traffic in search engines. 
On-page refers to both the content and HTML source code of a page that can be optimized, as opposed to off-page SEO which refers to links and other external signals.
<br>
Initially, before starting with SEO, I did an elaborate business research (value proposition, market size, etc), competitor analysis and keyword research using Google Advanced Search.
After finalizing my list of target keywords, I started with the process of Search Engine Optimization. Performed On-Page Search Engine Optimization by optimizing the title tag, meta description, meta keyword, meta robots, headings tags, anchor tags and the
alt text in img tags. The tags that required optimization were identified using online SEO tools available like Small SEO. 
Created an XML sitemap and Robots.txt file for my website.

## Online Advertising using Google Ads
I set up a Search Campaign using Google AdWords for my website. Search campaigns are used to show text ads on Google’s search result pages. These ads are triggered by search queries (the words a user types into the search prompt). 
You will be able to target these search queries by choosing keywords related to your product or service.

## Social Media Marketing
I built a presence for my business online by setting up a Facebook Page for it and also created an elaborate Facebook Marketing Plan for my website.
I created a Content Planning Calendar which is a rundown of all my upcoming posts organized by date, time, theme and type of content to continuously engage with my audience.
I also set up an Engagement Campaign using Facebook Ads Manager with the Converstion location as my website. 

## Tracking Website Traffic
Checking the Performance of your website is very important. Monitoring and Analysing website traffic and user activity on your website is crucial to conversions.
I set up Google Analytics for my website using the 'Google Tag' code. Google Analytics provided a detailed report containing Realtime data, User Acquisition, 
Traffic Acquisition, User Engagement, Conversions, Monetization, User Retention, User Demographics and User Technology. This report was used to improve the performance of my website.
